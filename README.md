This project implements a credit risk assessment system using graph-based analysis techniques. It models the relationships between borrowers using a directed graph, where nodes represent borrowers and edges represent financial transactions. The project includes functionalities for:

CIBIL Score Management: Set and manage credit scores for borrowers.
Transaction Management: Add, remove, and display transactions between borrowers.
Graph Traversal Algorithms: Perform BFS (Breadth-First Search) and DFS (Depth-First Search) to explore the borrower network.
Dijkstra's Algorithm: Calculate the shortest path in terms of transaction amounts between borrowers.
Fraud Detection: Identify potential fraud cases based on transaction amounts exceeding a specified percentage of the borrowers' credit limits.
Network Visualization: Visualize the borrower network using SFML, with nodes representing borrowers colored by their credit scores and edges representing transactions.
